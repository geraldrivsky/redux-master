# Getting Started

This is an example of my code where I use technologies: **React**, **Redux Toolkit**, **RTK Query**, **Typescript**.

The project is a list of posts that you can create, edit and delete yourself. The posts are on the backend, which is created using json-server.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install -g json-server`

Installs JSON Server.

### `json-server --watch db.json --port 5000`

Starts JSON Server.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
